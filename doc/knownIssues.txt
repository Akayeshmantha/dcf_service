- topic, channel, datachannel, column name cannot have char (.,-/ _#'^)

- every datachannel is better to have always key in field list

- drop and recreation of streams cause -> added dcfs.streams.recreate=false which create only new Streams

question "IBM MessageHub is currently based on Kafka 0.10.2 whereas KSQL 4.1 is compatible with Kafka 0.11.x. Hence I am trying with KSQL 0.4.x branch." 
reply "This was actually a bug in the documentation IIRC. All prior KSQL versions including 0.4 only worked with Kafka 0.11 and later. They never worked with 0.10.2."
